# How to Build a Serverless Web Application Using AWS

This project demonstrates how to build a serverless web application using various AWS services, including Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.
## Prerequisites

- An AWS account
- Basic knowledge of AWS services like Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB
- AWS CLI installed (optional)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript or Node.js

## Steps

### 1. **Set Up API Gateway**
   - In the AWS Console, navigate to **API Gateway**.
   - Create a new API and configure it with the required methods (GET, POST).
   - Set the API Gateway to trigger AWS Lambda functions.

### 2. **Create AWS Lambda Function**
   - Navigate to **AWS Lambda** in the AWS Console.
   - Create a new function in Node.js (or your preferred runtime).
   - Write the code for processing requests (e.g., adding, retrieving data from DynamoDB).

### 3. **Set Up DynamoDB**
   - Navigate to **DynamoDB** in the AWS Console.
   - Create a new table to store data (e.g., user info, blog posts).
   - Make sure the Lambda function has proper permissions to interact with DynamoDB.

### 4. **Connect the API Gateway with Lambda**
   - In API Gateway, link the Lambda function to the API Gateway methods.
   - Ensure the API is publicly accessible if required.

### 5. **Deploy the API**
   - Create a deployment stage in API Gateway and deploy the API to make it live.

### 6. **Frontend Setup**
   - Build a simple HTML/JavaScript front end to interact with the API.
   - The front end can send requests (GET, POST) to the API Gateway to interact with DynamoDB.

### 7. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Test the full application: 
     - Make sure the front end can interact with the API.
     - Ensure Lambda is performing the correct actions on DynamoDB.
   
### 8. **Deployment**
   - Once everything is working, deploy your application to a hosting service (like S3 for the static front end).

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can set up a fully functional serverless web application on AWS, leveraging Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.
